            top_layer (np.ndarray): Numpy 2d array of size (24, 15) containing flavor at each cell location

E.g. lets say the fourth element is {1: 0, 2: 8...} means the corresponding player with index 4 has 0 units of flavor 1 and 8 units of flavor
            get_turns_received (Callable[[], List[int]]): method which returns a list of integers corresponding to each player, each element at index i tells how many turns a player with index i has played so far.
